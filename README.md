This is a story posting application for posting scary stories. It's name is SCAREME! This project is courses introduced by Jay Lee in the website: www.codecutoff.com which is described as a clone of FMyLife.com.

I converted this project to ReactJS with Ruby on Rails with the help of Jay Lee article: "Add React.js to an Existing Rails Application Tutorial - Part 1". you can find it in the following link:

I added new tasks and build this project according to what I understand.

This project is built using ReactJS with Ruby on Rails.

Gems used in the project:
- react-rails: adding reactjs to rails
- devise: for authentication and managing users.
- bootswatch-rails: gem built on top of bootstrap thaat gives you themes.
- acts_as_votable: for managing upvotes and downvotes for stories.

To run the project follow these steps:
1. bundle install
2. rake db:migrate
3. rake db:seed   "to add categories"
4. add user by signing up.
5. explore the project.
